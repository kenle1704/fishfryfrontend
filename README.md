6. publish to the world
6.1 change dns zone to point your domain name to the env ip 
6.2 set up CloudFront  for your website , this will cache the content and will push up a lot , however it will have issue when development, thus we could recommend to have development env

TODO
1. Permission User 
It is very import to limit access to each user ( eg: operator, guide ), however i was not able to finish it in this project 
2. More friendly design for Dashboard like guide icon , ability to change guide or make some note 
3. Chat service, this will be really helpfull for operator and guide to communicate 
4. Expecting Return date, i found that by knowing when the boat will back to Harbor will help operator have more control over boats service 
5. Delete / unDelete will be usefull to avoid ghost data in database
